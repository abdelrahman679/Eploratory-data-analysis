# Eploratory-data-analysis
FIFA 19 complete player dataset

## Dataset
the  dataset have 18,207 rows and 89 columns.most of features are neumeric 
but some  categorical features exist and significant to show some important relations
the dataset can be found in the kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19)

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, i found that there was positive relation among all of features but 
under some conditions
i focused on wage variable and tried to investigate how the wage influenced by other features 
firstly i expected the wages have clear positive relation with score of other features
,the features represent a score of specific skill,
but after explatory analysis i found there are other criteria affect player wage more than skills

--#the first criterion is wage range in the club, there are clubs pay fixed wage for all players 
even when the players have variance in there skills

--#second one is international reputation, when players in same skills ,the player with high international reputation get more wage than player
have mide or low  international reputation

--#third one the postion rarity, the rare position get higher wags

***ball control have the highest impact on other skills specifically overall ,but when ball control below 50 the relation with overall become ambigous

***generally the most of skills score are normally distributed, 
when the skill score located after third quartile that's attract big and rich clubs that pay high wages
below first and second quartile the variance in skills approximatly have no influence on player wage

## Key Insights for Presentation
###for the presentation, i focus on 
**wage and value distribution 

**wage vs overall and value to see the common shape of relation between wage and skill features

**also i depict the most correlated features and the influence of ordinal variables
